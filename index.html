      <h2>Apple - The fruit</h2>
      <p>
        Apples are popular fruits enjoyed around the world for their crunchy
        texture and sweet or tart taste. They come in many colors like red,
        green, and yellow, with each type having its own flavor. Some apples are
        juicy and sweet, while others are crisp and sour. People eat apples
        fresh as a healthy snack, and they're also used in cooking and baking to
        make pies, applesauce, and cider. Their versatility makes them a
        favorite ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes.

        Nutritionally, apples are good for you. They are low in calories but
        high in important vitamins and minerals like vitamin C and potassium.
        Eating apples can help you feel full because they contain fiber, which
        is good for your digestion. They are also good for your teeth because
        their crunchy texture can clean your teeth and gums. That's why apples
        are often called a nutritious snack that can help keep you healthy.

        Isaac Newton discovering gravity when an apple fell on his head. In many
        countries, there are festivals and celebrations dedicated to apples,
        where people come together to enjoy different kinds of apple dishes and
        drinks. Overall, apples are not just a tasty fruit but also a symbol of
